Originally from Missouri, Corey started swimming before she could walk and has never looked back. She swam throughout childhood and through high school &amp;ndash; ultimately deciding to attend Stanford University, where she served as manager of the varsity women&amp;rsquo;s swimming team. After about 8 years away from competitive swimming, she tried her hand at some longer swims as a mental reprieve from her (rather flexible) &amp;ldquo;day-job&amp;rdquo; as a PhD Student in computer science. And let&amp;rsquo;s just say she fell in love with the water again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When she is not swimming, Corey is likely working on her doctoral dissertation or hanging out with her three unruly but incredibly adorable Golden Retrievers.&lt;/p>
