Corey Murphey is a marathon open water swimmer based in Colorado. Originally from Missouri, Corey started swimming before she could walk and has never looked back. She swam throughout childhood and through high school -- ultimately deciding to attend Stanford University, where she served as manager of the varsity women's swimming team. After about 8 years away from competitive swimming, she tried her hand at some longer swims as a mental reprieve from her (rather flexible) "day-job" as a PhD Student in computer science. And let's just say she fell in love with the water again. 

When she is not swimming, Corey is likely working on her doctoral dissertation or hanging out with her three unruly but incredibly adorable Golden Retrievers.
